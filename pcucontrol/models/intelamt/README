Remote Control sample application:
----------------------------------
This sample application demonstrates how to retrieve information 
about the Intel® AMT device capabilities and the power state 
of the remote machine, and how to control remotely the boot 
and power state of the managed PC.


How to run the sample (X32 and X64 environment):
------------------------------------------------
1. Run "make" from a command prompt. "remoteControl" should be created.
2. Make sure that the Intel(R) AMT device has been activated on the target
   machine.
3. Use the generated executable as described in the command usage (type the 
   command to obtain the usage instructions).

Notes:
------
1. This sample uses gSOAP library. 
2. In order to compile the sample code it is essential to put the directories
   ThirdParty, Include, Lib, Src and Samples in the same structure as in the
   Intel® AMT SDK.
